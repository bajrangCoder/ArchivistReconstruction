# The Archivist's Reconstruction

> _"Seek the order within the scattered ink."_

**The Archivist's Reconstruction** is a zen-like puzzle experience where you take on the role of a meticulous scribe tasked with restoring ancient, fragmented manuscripts. Volume VIII of this ongoing preservation effort invites you to find harmony in chaos through the careful arrangement of ink stamps.

## 🖋️ The Concept

In a world of fading ink and crumbling parchment, the Archivist must piece together the remnants of lost knowledge. Every block placed is a word restored; every line cleared is a verse preserved. As you play, the archive whispers fragments of wisdom to guide your hand.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To begin your work in the Great Archive:

1. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

2. **Launch the Preservation Server**:

   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

3. Open your browser to the local address provided by Vite to start the reconstruction.
